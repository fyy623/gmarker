When the first human, the ancestor of all of us, 

left the tree and touched the earth for the first time, 

at that moment, he would never realize that tiny step actually changed the destiny of a species or even a planet.

When I started typing this readme, I am honestly more about wrapping everything up and turning to my lovely coze bed, as it is 11:06 PM at Pittsburgh,

rather than imagining the future of this "craft", which most likely my boss would have been doing a lot.

But history is always about repetition and recurrence.

Am I touching the earth with my coworkers now?

:D
